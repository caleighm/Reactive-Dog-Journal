# History of Reactive-Dog-Journal
I first started this Reactive Dog Journal (RDJ) at the UBC Local Hack Day in December 2016. I had a vague idea of what I wanted -- a simple app to replace what I was doing in Notepad every day for my dog -- and no idea how to implement. I decided on Python and the wxPython library since a) I liked Python and b) it seemed similar to the little GUIs I had made in Java with Swing in class a year ago.

This was a big mistake.

Although I happily worked on it for about 10 hours in one day, when I later reflected on my progress, I realized it was turning into a big mess: structurally disorganized, tedious to program (so many buttons and menus...), and inelegant to look at.

I asked Reddit what to do, and they answered: Scrap it! Start again with the Django framework and make a way cooler web app.

So that's what I'm doing.

You'll find the Reactive-Dog-Journal-2 repository is much more up-to-date, but I leave this up here just in case I decide to finish it some day or in case somebody else can learn from my mistakes!

# Features to come ...
This is still significantly a work in progress.

TODO:
- refactor!
- fix "Edit" dialog box
- search and sort saved entries
- Report functionality in general

WISHLIST:
- turn into a web app
- database with Django?
